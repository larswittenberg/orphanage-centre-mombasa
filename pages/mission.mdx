## Our goals

Our specified goal is to address their needs and formulate ways of attending to them by acquiring assistance in the form of donation gifts and money from charitable donor communities, charitable organizations both international and local, well-wishers, volunteers, local communities and government.

> My biggest aim is to see that the children are well protected and cared for but also to widen up the centre or even go to different parts of the country, because there are so many children who urgently need our assistance.
