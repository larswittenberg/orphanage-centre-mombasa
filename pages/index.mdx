Child of Mercy Orphanage Centre (COMOC) was formed in 2010 and is situated within a half-acre walled plot close to Shelly Beach, and a five minute walk from the Likoni slum area south of Mombasa. It is home to 23 children – both boys and girls from ages 5-15 years. Before getting here the children had lives without any prospects: They are orphans without a family, neglected and abandoned children who lived on the street or from poor families who could not afford to take care of the children.

Jessy, the Director of the Orphanage Centre, as well as all the workers at COMOC, offer a home to the children where they can act like a child and also be prepared for their adult life. The children get all necessities like food, clothes, medicine, education, aspirations for life and most importantly love and support. Jessy indeed became a mom for 23 children.

But to offer the children such a life, they are completely reliant on donations of well-wishing people.

> The happiest moment for me is when I see the children.
> I know that there is always a light, which will shine for us. It is my biggest aim to offer the children here a good life with everything that they need. The children and I are so grateful for every kind of help.
